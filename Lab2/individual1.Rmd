```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
choco = read.csv("choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

1.  How are ratings distributed
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating, main="Rating distribution", xlab="Ratings")
```
<br/>
Another view of the distribution is to use a density plot
```{r}
plot(density(choco$Rating), main="Density plot of ratings", xlab="Rating")
```


2.  Do ratings depend on the percentage of cocao?
```{r}
boxplot(Rating ~ factor(Cocoa.Pct), data=choco, main="Ratings vs Cocoa Percentage", xlab="Percent of Cocoa", ylab="Rating")

```

The answer seems to be yes.  From the boxplot, the higher average ratings occur between 63 and 70% chocolate.  **You could also calculate the mean value for data in each 10% range and plot those in a bar chart: [x-axis is each 10% range and y-axis is average rating]**
