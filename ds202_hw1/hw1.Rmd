## An Example of Data Science

One example of data science I have experience with is in the financial services industry creating optimal portfolios.  The process is simple using Microsoft Excel and begins with collecting *at least* ten years of financial data on a collection of stocks from a site like Yahoo Finance.  A statistical analysis of the historical daily stock price changes can then be used to create a covariance matrix and using the Sharpe ratio and a nonlinear optimization routine in Solver, we can determine the optimal weights of each stock in the portfolio.

## Version of R

The current version of R can be found by typing **version** into the R console as below.  Note the code command below shows both the *trunk* of the code as well as the output.

```{r version}
